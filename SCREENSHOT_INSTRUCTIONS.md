# Screenshot Instructions

To complete the README setup, please manually add the game screenshot:

1. Save the game screenshot as `screenshot.png`
2. Place it in the `/PIXEL-TAVERN-V2/assets/` folder
3. The README.md will automatically display it with the path `./assets/screenshot.png`

The screenshot should show the medieval fantasy slot game interface with:
- The tavern setting background
- 5x3 slot machine with character symbols
- UI elements (bet controls, spin button, credits display)
- Medieval/fantasy theming

This will complete the documentation for the enhanced game with the new pause system and audio improvements.
